== Scope

The purpose of this document is to provide a standard representation
of date and time that has time scale component values clearly
delimited by designated symbols, in order to minimize necessary
assumptions inherent to the representation format itself.

This document only supports date elements from the Gregorian calendar and
times from the 24-hour clock.

Date and time format representations described in this document
utilizes numbers, alphabets and symbols defined in <<ISOIEC646>>.
These representations are meant to be both human recognizable and
machine readable. Character encoding of the representations is
not covered in this document.
